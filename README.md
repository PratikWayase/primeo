### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding

* Define the business objective (e.g., predict house prices, sales forecasting).
* Identify if the problem is regression or classification.
* Set success metrics like R¬≤, RMSE, MAE.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection

* Gather data from databases, APIs, or CSVs.
* Ensure data completeness, freshness, and relevance.
* Log data sources for reproducibility.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration (EDA)

* Use pandas, matplotlib, seaborn for visualization.
* Understand distributions, outliers, correlations, missing values.
* Check correlation matrix to detect multicollinearity.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing

* Handle missing values (mean, median, mode, or drop).
* Handle outliers (Winsorize or cap).
* Encode categorical variables (LabelEncoder or OneHotEncoder).
* Convert data types correctly.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering

* Create interaction or domain-specific features.
* Remove redundant or highly correlated features.
* Transform skewed data (log, sqrt, Box-Cox).
* Standardize or normalize feature scales.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Train-Test Split

* Split dataset into train and test sets.
* Prevent data leakage from test to train.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building

* Use LinearRegression from sklearn.
* Fit model on training data.
* Analyze coefficients, intercept, feature importance.
* Use Ridge or Lasso if multicollinearity exists.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation

* Predict on test data.
* Evaluate using R¬≤, RMSE, MAE.
* Plot residuals to check randomness and zero-mean.

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Assumption Checks

* Linearity: check scatter plots.
* Homoscedasticity: residual variance should be constant.
* Normality of errors: histogram or QQ plot.
* No multicollinearity: ensure VIF < 5.
* Independence of errors: use Durbin‚ÄìWatson test.

---

### üîü Model Tuning and Validation

* Apply cross-validation (KFold, GridSearchCV).
* Try feature subsets and regularization (L1/L2).

---

### 11Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment & Monitoring

* Save model using joblib or pickle.
* Integrate model into API or app.
* Monitor model drift and retrain when needed.

---

### 12Ô∏è‚É£ Documentation & Reporting

* Document data sources, preprocessing, modeling assumptions.
* Include evaluation metrics and limitations.
* Suggest future improvements.
